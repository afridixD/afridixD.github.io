      <p>
        My name is Afridi, student of HSC batch 2021 and a proud student of BIAM
        Laboratory School and College, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. I am currently
        learning Game Development from different helpful websites and also by
        watching videos from Youtube. I am using the Unity game engine as a
        beginner and hoping to get better at it soon. This has been my most
        favourite field among other fields in the World of Computer Science. I
        am also interested in different coding languages. I had learned the
        basics of C and C++ and hoping to learn other coding languages like
        Java, Javascript, Python and plenty more. I am also willing to learn Web
        Development and AI. I want to expand my knowledge in this field as well.
        <br />
        <br />
        Other than these, I am eager to learn different new things like editing,
        photography, sleights of hands, pen spinning, solving cubes and plenty
        others which I find interesting.
